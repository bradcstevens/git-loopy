"""``ralph_afk.interactive.state`` — the Textual-agnostic live run model.

:class:`LiveRunState` is the **interactive sink** in the issue #22 fan-out
(ADR-0001): the ralph loop dispatches every wrapper event — and every streaming
reasoning/message delta — to it, and the Textual app *observes* it to paint the
screen. The app reads; the loop writes; both run on the one asyncio event loop,
so no locking is needed.

This module is **deep and pure** — stdlib + ``typing`` only, **no Textual**, no
``rich``, no SDK — so the run model stays unit-testable without a TTY and
honours the repo's import-guard convention (ADR-0001; mirrors
:mod:`ralph_afk.sinks`). Enforced by
``tests/test_interactive_state.py::test_state_module_imports_are_constrained``.

Because importing :mod:`ralph_afk.events` would pull the Copilot SDK (it types
``map_sdk_event`` against the SDK's event package), the handful of event-type
string literals this module switches on are re-declared locally. Their values —
not the constant names — are the contract; a parity test
(``test_state_event_type_constants_match_events``) keeps them in lockstep with
:mod:`ralph_afk.events`.

The model carries what the live **header band** needs (run id, model +
reasoning effort, run-start wall clock, live-ticking elapsed timer, iteration
number, run status, strike count ``x/N``) and, from issue #25, the **per-run
ledger**: a record keyed by issue ref of every issue seen in any pool this run,
with its status (queued / active / closed / advanced / no-progress / gone) and
its waiting + active timing. The active issue is attributed from the agent's
**working marker** (``<working issue=N>``, tapped off the message stream) with a
commit-time ``Closes #N`` backstop.

From issue #36 (ADR-0003) each ledger entry also carries **per-issue
consumption**: the input/output tokens of every ``usage.tokens`` event observed
while the issue was active (the model they were billed against too), **summed
across every iteration** that worked it — attributed to the same Active issue as
the timing and Log, with the same pending-pre-marker flush. The Queue renders
these as live tokens-in / tokens-out / estimated-cost columns; summed they
reconcile with the run-level **Summary** totals (which still account per
iteration).

From issue #34 (ADR-0003) the model also carries the **per-issue Logs**: one
bounded ring-buffer tail *per issue*, keyed by ref, of interleaved reasoning
(dimmed), assistant message text, and key structured events (tool calls,
commits, closures) in time order. Each issue's Log **accumulates across every
iteration** that worked it (it is *not* reset at iteration boundaries) and is
bounded per issue, so opening any Queue row's Log shows that issue's own record.
Output produced before the iteration's **working marker** is held in a pending
buffer and attributed to the active issue once it is known. The *full* record
stays in the always-on JSONL replay log on disk, so each per-issue tail can stay
bounded over a long (up to ~2-hour) run. (This supersedes issue #27's single
iteration-scoped, active-only transcript; the term "transcript" is retired in
favour of **Log**.)
